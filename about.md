Ruby is a great programming language. Blogs, tens of it is been written about it
every day. As a ruby programmer I need them. The sad part is its distributed in many
domains. I might read one which could be useful, but when I need it, I may not be
able to find it. To combact such situations, I am starting to collect Great Ruby
Blogs around the planet. I am putting it on the internet so that all can benefit
from it.
